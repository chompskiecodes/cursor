# Granular Architecture: Voice Booking System

---

### üö® Development & Integration Notes

1. **Field Naming Consistency**
   - Always use `business_id` (not `locationId`, `location_id`, or `locationID`) for location/business references in all API payloads, docs, and code.
   - All documentation and test scripts should use `business_id` for clarity and backend compatibility.

2. **Practitioner Name Columns**
   - The practitioners table may not have a `full_name` column. Use the actual schema column (e.g., `name`, `first_name` + `last_name`, or check your DB schema).
   - Update scripts and queries to match your real DB schema.

3. **Database Pool Initialization**
   - Standalone scripts (not running under FastAPI) must manually initialize the asyncpg connection pool using `asyncpg.create_pool` with the correct `DATABASE_URL`.
   - Do not rely on FastAPI‚Äôs dependency injection or shared pool for standalone scripts.

4. **Legacy/Flat Fields**
   - All legacy/flat fields (e.g., `locationId`, `location_id`, etc.) have been removed from the API and documentation.
   - If you see these in any code or docs, update them to the current field names.

5. **Branching Logic for Availability**
   - If a user requests a specific practitioner, only offer slots for that practitioner (searching future days if needed).
   - If a user requests a service or ‚Äúany‚Äù practitioner, offer the next available slot with any practitioner.

6. **Test Scripts**
   - Test scripts must use the same field names as the backend (e.g., `business_id`).
   - When debugging, check both the payload and the backend handler for field name mismatches.

7. **Error Handling**
   - If you see ‚ÄúDatabase pool not initialized,‚Äù ensure your script is initializing the pool (see above).
   - If you see ‚Äúcolumn ... does not exist,‚Äù check your DB schema and update queries accordingly.

## main.py

### 1. Application Initialization

- **Environment Loading:**  
  Loads environment variables using `dotenv` for configuration (database, API keys, etc).

- **FastAPI App Setup:**  
  - Instantiates a FastAPI app with custom title/version.
  - Configures CORS to allow all origins, methods, and headers.
  - Sets up logging with different verbosity for development vs production.
  - Loads routers for all tool modules (location, availability, booking, practitioner, etc).

- **Database and Cache Initialization:**  
  - On startup, creates an asyncpg connection pool to the database.
  - Initializes a `CacheManager` for caching frequently accessed data.
  - Sets up dependency injection for DB pool and cache manager in tool modules.
  - In production, starts a background task for incremental cache sync (every 5 minutes, syncs appointments for all active clinics).

- **Health and Monitoring Endpoints:**  
  - `/health`: Checks DB connection and returns status.
  - `/cache-stats`: Returns cache statistics and hit rates.

- **API Key Authentication:**  
  - All protected endpoints require an `x-api-key` header matching the configured API key (except in development mode).

- **Root Endpoint:**  
  - Returns a list of available endpoints and service metadata.

---

### 2. Webhook Handler: `/post-call-webhook`

- **Purpose:**  
  Receives post-call events from ElevenLabs (e.g., after a voice call completes).

- **Security:**  
  - If `ELEVENLABS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set, verifies the HMAC signature in the `ElevenLabs-Signature` header.
  - Signature is checked for freshness (within 5 minutes) and correctness.

- **Process:**
  1. Logs the incoming payload.
  2. If `agent_id` is present, looks up the associated clinic in the database.
  3. Extracts call data and analysis from the payload.
  4. Logs whether the call was successful or failed (with transcript summary if available).
  5. Returns `{"status": "success"}`.

- **Requirements:**
  - Must be called by ElevenLabs with a valid signature (if secret is set).
  - Payload must include `agent_id` and `data.analysis` for full logging.

- **Order of Operations:**
  1. Verify signature (if required).
  2. Parse and log payload.
  3. Lookup clinic by agent ID (if present).
  4. Log call outcome.
  5. Respond with success.

---

### 3. Router Inclusion

- All tool routers are included in the main app, making their endpoints available at the root level.

## tools/timezone_utils.py

### Overview
This module centralizes all timezone handling logic for the voice booking system. It provides robust utilities for converting, parsing, and formatting datetimes between UTC and local clinic timezones, ensuring consistent and user-friendly time handling across all endpoints.

---

### Key Functions

- **ensure_utc(dt: datetime) -> datetime**
  - Ensures a datetime is in UTC. Naive datetimes are assumed to be in the default timezone (Australia/Sydney) and converted to UTC.
  - Used to standardize all datetimes before storage or API calls.

- **ensure_aware(dt: datetime, timezone: ZoneInfo) -> datetime**
  - Ensures a datetime is timezone-aware, assigning the provided timezone if naive.

- **parse_cliniko_time(time_str: str) -> datetime**
  - Parses a time string from the Cliniko API, handling both 'Z' (UTC) and offset formats. Returns a UTC datetime.
  - Used for ingesting appointment and availability times from Cliniko.

- **local_to_utc(local_dt: datetime, timezone: ZoneInfo) -> datetime**
  - Converts a local (timezone-aware or naive) datetime to UTC.

- **utc_to_local(utc_dt: datetime, timezone: ZoneInfo = DEFAULT_TZ) -> datetime**
  - Converts a UTC datetime to the specified local timezone (default: Australia/Sydney).

- **combine_date_time_local(date_obj: date, hour: int, minute: int, timezone: ZoneInfo) -> datetime**
  - Combines a date and time (hour, minute) in a local timezone, returning a UTC datetime.
  - Used for constructing appointment datetimes from user input.

- **format_for_display(dt: datetime, timezone: ZoneInfo = DEFAULT_TZ) -> str**
  - Formats a datetime for user display in local time (e.g., '9:30 AM').

- **format_date_for_display(dt: datetime, timezone: ZoneInfo = DEFAULT_TZ) -> str**
  - Formats a date for user display in local time (e.g., 'Monday, January 1, 2024').

- **get_clinic_timezone(clinic) -> ZoneInfo**
  - Retrieves the timezone for a clinic object, with robust fallback to the default timezone.
  - Used throughout the system to ensure all time calculations are clinic-local.

- **convert_utc_to_local(utc_time_str: str, timezone: Union[str, ZoneInfo, None] = None) -> datetime**
  - Converts a UTC time string to a local timezone-aware datetime.
  - Used for formatting and presenting times to users.

- **format_time_for_voice(dt: datetime) -> str**
  - Formats a datetime for voice agent responses (e.g., '9:30 AM').

---

### Usage
- All routers and booking logic use these utilities to ensure:
  - Consistent conversion between UTC (for storage/API) and local time (for user display).
  - Robust handling of naive datetimes and timezones from various sources (user input, Cliniko API, database).
  - User-facing messages always present times in the correct local timezone for the clinic.
